<h1 style="text-decoration : underline; color :brown;">About Us</h1>
<br>
<p>Bloggers.com is the king of free blogging sites.
   It is a free platform and can be worked from here, but you need to build the site mostly by yourself afterward.
   While you can find some free WordPress hosting, a better long-term strategy is to pay a moderate amount for standard
    Bloggers hosting.</p>

<p>This is where Bluehost comes into play.
   Not only is it very cheap (just $2.95 per month on the Basic plan), but it also
   provides solid features, including a free domain name, 50GB of disk space, unmetered
   bandwidth, free SSL, and 100MB of email storage per account. At this very moment, Bluehost
   is the cheapest sensible Bloggers hosting you can find out there.</p>

<p>Because youâ€™re hosting the Bloggers software yourself,
  you have full control over how your site looks and functions, as well as how you make money
  from your site. But the flip side is that the setup process is a little bit more hands-on.</p>
